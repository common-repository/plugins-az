== Description ==
If you have a lot of plugins installed and want to scroll to a certain plugin it's quite tedious to use the mouse wheel or the scroll bar. With this plugin you can jump to the first plugin with the same first letter as the plugin you want to see. Nice time saver.

== Installation ==
Install via WordPress' "add plugin" feature or download it from wordpress.org and copy the file's content into your
plugin directory.

In the settings you can switch between "short" and "long" display of the letters (see screenshots).

== Screenshots ==

1. Displaying only the first letters for the installed plugins.
2. Displaying all letters
3. Wordpress < v4.3 is sorting special charcters in a different way.
4. Settings
